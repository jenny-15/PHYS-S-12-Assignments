Idea:
-A wearable device on the wrist that allows you to focus by sending a small and safe electrical current onto your wrist when you start procrastinating or become distracted.
	--The current should be irritating but not painful
	--An alternative, if a current is unsafe, would be a vibration or loud beeping noise
--It can shock when you pick up your phone or other electronics.
-The device can include a lie detector that tracks your heartbeat to determine if you are lying about doing your work
-The device can be used through an app which allows you to create blocks of time in which you do not use electronics. 

Tools:
Solder, glue?, 3D printing



Materials:

Lie detector-
Heartbeat sensor, arduino, breadboard, Jumper Wire, 16x2 LCD Display, 10k ohm Potentiometer
Tutorial on heartbeat sensors with Arduino: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTkroVP3y0k

Electric shock-
Electrode wire, or copper tape, or conductive rubber and wires
Or I could use something similar to electric fly swatters- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK1RP60Y45M

Hardware-
Silicon for the wristband, rechargeable battery, aluminum

Software-
Bluetooth chip, and ...?
