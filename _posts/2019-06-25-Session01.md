### Day 1 Lab- June 26, 2019
The first day in the lab I did the following:
Download and install Arduino IDE 
Make a Protoboard Circuit with resistor and LED. 
Solder an Arduino Nano
Make a circuit using the Arduino Nano, and load a program into it. (requires soldering, and downloading driver.)


Task #1: Installing Arduino IDE
This task was fairly simple and I used the following link to install the program- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Task #2: Making a Protoboard Circuit
Materials- breadboard, battery, wire, wire cutter, red lightbulbs, 100 olm resistors, and ___

Task #3: Soldering
Materials- solder gun, arduino nano, metal wire

Task #4: Creating a circuit w/ Arduino Nano and using the blink program
After soldering the Arduino Nano, I downloaded CH340 Drivers to add the blink program. However, after downloading the blink program and adding the blink function, I was unable to get the Arduino Nano to download it. Error messages were showing up, and, after a bit of research, I found that the problem was due to the Mac Mojave software on my computer. I am not really sure how to fix this problem yet, but I will update this page if I fix the problem.
