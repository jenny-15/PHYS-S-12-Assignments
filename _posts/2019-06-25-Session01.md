### Day 1 Lab- June 26, 2019
The first day in the lab I did the following:
Download and install Arduino IDE 
Make a Protoboard Circuit with resistor and LED. 
Solder an Arduino Nano
Make a circuit using the Arduino Nano, and load a program into it. (requires soldering, and downloading driver.)


Task #1: Installing Arduino IDE This task was fairly simple and I used the following link to install the program- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Task #2: Making a Protoboard Circuit Materials- breadboard, battery, wire, wire cutter, red lightbulbs, 100 olm resistors, and an Arduino.

To create a functioning breadboard, attach the Arduino into a power source. Then, attach two wires into the Arduino. Attach one to “GND”, and the other to “5V” (Image 2). Then, attach the other end of the wire connected to GND into a positive column of the breadboard, preferably the one on the very left. Then, attach the wire connected to 5V to a negative column, preferably the column on the very right side of the breadboard (Image 1). Then, to create a basic circuit, you need to have at least 3 wires, a 100 olm resister, and a lightbulb (Image 3). Connect a wire from the positive and negative column and place the other end of both wires anywhere on the board. Then, connect a resistor to either row that the two wires are in. Finally, attach a lightbulb by connecting the longer wire attached to the end of the lightbulb to the row of a wire or resistor that is connected to the positive column, and the shorter wire on the lightbulb to the row where the negative wire or resister is.

In Image 10 and 11, I created a parallel and series circuit. By pushing the switch, one of the lights turn off and the other becomes brighter.

Task #3: Soldering Materials- solder gun, Arduino nano, metal wire, breadboard

First, attach the Arduino as seen in my pictures (Image 5, 6, 7, 8). Then, to solder, heat up the solder gun by connecting it to power and turning it on (Image 4). Once it's heated, take the metal wire and solder gun. Place the metal wire at the bottom of the any of the wires poking out, and use the gun to fuse the metal wire and the Arduino wire together. The end result should look like a volcano (Image 9), so the top of the Arduino wire is almost untouched.

Task #4: Creating a circuit w/ Arduino Nano and using the blink program 
After soldering the Arduino Nano, I downloaded CH340 Drivers to add the blink program. However, after downloading the blink program and adding the blink function, I was unable to get the Arduino Nano to download it. Error messages were showing up, and, after a bit of research, I found that the problem was due to the Mac Mojave software on my computer. I am not really sure how to fix this problem yet, but I will update this page if I fix the problem.


Overall:
I learned about working with Arduinos. I had a little bit of experience working with circuits, but I had not used Arduino's or soldered before.
