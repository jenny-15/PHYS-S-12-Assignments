### 06: 3D Design and Printin

Today we made 3D models on Fusion 360 and printed our designs. I printed 2 designs, the first I made before class, and the second I made based off the first one with slight modifications based on the first one.

Steps:
Use Fusion 360 to create your 3d model. Use the extrude function to chaneg your model from 2D to 3D. There are many basic tutorials that you can follow on Youtube to get started.
Save the 3D design as a STL and import it into Ultimaker Cura.
From Cura, save the file as a G-code and transfer it into a SD card through a card reader
Insert the SD card into the printer and select your file
Print


What I learned:
I learned about 3D modeling using Fusion 360. I have had no experience in CAD prior to this class, so it was interesting to learn about how to use the software. I got to play around with the software. At first, I tried following a youtube tutorial for how to make an enclosure for Arduino Uno, which was easy to follow, but it took too long and we also had to print a object that would take around 15 minutes, so I made a coin instead.  At first, I just had a plain circle with the letter J, but I eventually ended up with a 12 sided polygon with both of my initials. I also added a hole, also a polygon, at the top of my coin so that I could string it onto something if I wanted to. I have never 3D printed anything, so this whole experience was very enjoyable. I got to see the whole process, from the modeling to the actual printing. 

It was also very inspirational to listen to the speakers talk about the future of 3D printing and where the technology is right now. We got to learn about scanners and how many museums are using them to replicate and preserve artifacts. There are a lot of medical applications for 3D printing, like in dentistry or organ printing (which is still being developed). It is also unrealistsic to 3D print home because the overall cost will nto cheaper, but it could become beneficial to create new cities on another planet where there are not as many resources so 3D printing is more cost-effective.


Problems:
When importing my file from Fusion 360 to Ultimaker Cura, my scale was messed up and I had to readjust the scale in Cura. Other than that, everything went pretty smoothly. I am not really sure why I keep having trouble with scaling.
