### 06: 3D Design and Printing

Today we made 3D models on Fusion 360 and printed our designs. I printed 3 designs, the first I made before class, and the final one I made based off the previous one with slight modifications.

Steps:
Use Fusion 360 to create your 3d model. Use the extrude function to chaneg your model from 2D to 3D. There are many basic tutorials that you can follow on Youtube to get started.
Save the 3D design as a STL and import it into Ultimaker Cura.
From Cura, save the file as a G-code and transfer it into a SD card through a card reader
Insert the SD card into the printer and select your file
Print


Problems:
When importing my file from Fusion 360 to Ultimaker Cura, my scale was messed up and I had to readjust the scale in Cura. When I made my design before class, since my designs imported into Cura larger than I had made them in Fusion, I remade them in Fusion several times since the print time was really long. I did not realize the problem was that my designs were importing larger than I made them, until lab time. My first print came out a little larger than intended, so I made a second one with a larger hole at the to a little bit larger so that I could actually fit something through (string or a chain). I used the same design for the second and final print (Design 2). While printing the second time, the coin got caught in the border that the printer made, so I printed the coin again (using the same design). In my final print, I also made the scale of Design 2 smaller. Other than my scaling issues, everything went pretty smoothly.


What I learned:
I learned about 3D modeling using Fusion 360. I had no experience in CAD prior to this class, so it was interesting to learn about how to use the software. At first, I tried following a youtube tutorial for how to make an enclosure for Arduino Uno, which was easy to follow, but it took too long and we also had to print a object that would take around 15 minutes, so I made a coin instead. I learned about how to start with a 2D shape and use the extrude function to make it 3D. My first design was just a plain circle with the letter J, but, in my final design, I had a 12 sided polygon with my complete initials. I also added a hole, also a polygon, at the top of my coin so that I could string it onto something if I wanted to. I have never 3D printed anything, so this whole experience was very enjoyable. I got to see the whole process, from the modeling to the actual printing. 

There were speaker who came in during class. I learned that when 3D printing first started, everyone imaged that, in the future, pretty much everything could be printed. It would make people self-sufficient and people could print everything they needed, including everyday items. Unfortunately, the reality is that 3D printers are only useful for certain tasks.

It was also very inspirational to listen to the speakers talk about the future of 3D printing and where the technology is right now. We got to learn about scanners. They work by taking many images and compiling them in a software to create a model. Consumer grade scanners are not useful for picking up small details, but proffesional (and expensive) ones are so advanced that they have precision that goes up to 1/10th of a mm. Many museums use them to replicate and preserve artifacts. n area in which the technology falls short is reflective surfaces. It would be hard to scan something like a mirror, watch, or any other shiny surface.
There are a lot of medical applications for 3D printing, like in dentistry or organ printing (which is still being developed). It is also unrealistic to 3D print homes because the overall cost will not be cheaper, but it could become beneficial to create new cities on another planet where there are not as many resources so 3D printing is more cost-effective.

During class, we were shown examples of some 3D printing applications. I have attatched pcitures below.
