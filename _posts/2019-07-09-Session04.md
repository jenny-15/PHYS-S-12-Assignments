### Header 3

Today I worked on my final project prototype. My prototype is a wristband that buzzes and vibrates when a button is pushed. Eventually, I will replace the button so that the wristband reacts when you use electronics to keep you focused. 

Materials: Arduino Uno/Nano, breadboard, fabric/flexible material, glue, wires, vibrating motor, buzzer, hook and eye, string, needle, scissors, wire strippers, computer


The first thing that I did was create a circuit using a breadboard and an Arduino Nano. The circuit diagram for the buzzer is Image 1, and I also added a button which is not in the diagram. Then, for the motor, I connected the ground side to the same switch as for the buzzer (in a parallel circuit) and simply connected the 5V directly to the circuit.

The next step was creating a wristband. I measured out the amount of material that I needed to wrap around my wrist and then cut it with scissors.
After creating a wristband, I attached the motor and buzzer to the wristband. I did so by sticking the wires connected to the motor and buzzer through the material. Then, I soldered the wires to ensure that they stuck (Image 2,3,4).

Next, I attached more material to the wristband to cover up the motor and buzzer (Image 5+6) using glue (Image 7).

Then, I programmed the Arduino with this code for the buzzer:

const int buzzer = 10; //buzzer to arduino pin 10

void setup() {
  //start serial connection
  Serial.begin(9600);
  //configure pin 2 as an input and enable the internal pull-up resistor
  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT); // Set buzzer - pin 9 as an output

}

void loop() {
  //read the pushbutton value into a variable
  int sensorVal = digitalRead(2);
  //print out the value of the pushbutton
  Serial.println(sensorVal);

  // Keep in mind the pull-up means the pushbutton's logic is inverted. It goes
  // HIGH when it's open, and LOW when it's pressed. Turn on pin 13 when the
  // button's pressed, and off when it's not:
  if (sensorVal == LOW) {
    tone(buzzer, 1000); // Send 1KHz sound signal...
  } else {
    noTone(buzzer);     // Stop sound...
  }
}



The final step was to sew a hook and eye onto the wristband. I put them on opposite sides of the wristband and using a needle and thread to attach them. The hook and eye are in image 5+6 after sewing them on.

Final result:

Challenges:
The first obstacle that I faced was attaching the motor and buzzer to the wristband. They both took a while to attach and secure, and then they both snapped off. So I had to solder new ones onto the wristband which took even more time. They are pretty secure now.
Another difficulty I had was with the Arduino Nano. I still cannot upload from my computer to it, so I had to switch to an Arduino Uno at the end, and so I had rewire the circuit board a bit.
The last difficulty that I had was sewing the hook and eye. I have not had much experience in sewing so it was slightly frustrating to start over if my initial placement of the hook/eye was incorrect.

Thoughts:
Overall I think that the prototype turned out okay. For my final project, I will use a different material to make the wristband. The one that I used was not that easy to work with and it was difficult to shape it into what I needed since it was came in the form of a thin strip. It was unable to completely cover the motor and buzzer, and it did not look very good. Another thing that I have to consider is how I will place the vibrating motor. It needs enough space to vibrate because the tip needs spcae to rotate, so it cannot be held too tightly. This further complicates which material I should use for the wristband. I need enough space to contain an Arduino Nano, motor, and buzzer. Iâ€™m not sure how I will do this without making the wristband too bulky.
