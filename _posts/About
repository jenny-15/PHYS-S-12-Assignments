This is my edited webpage for PHYS-S12: Introduction to Digital Fabrication. My name is Jenny, and I am a rising junior. As hobbies, I like to fence and read. I am interested in a wide variety of subjects, but they all center around the development of society. I am very interested in current events, so I am interested in fields that will allow me to tackle some of the issues that the modern world faces. For example, I am interested in preserving the environment. So, when thinking of some of the best ways to help this cause, I thought about exploring areas of science in which i could create solutions that will best help the environment; these include clean energy, physics, and engineering.
