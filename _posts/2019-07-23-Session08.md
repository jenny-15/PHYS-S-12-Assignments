### 08: CNC Milling

Today we worked on CNC milling and making composite shells. I worked with Kosi and we agreed on making a seashell. 

Compositing:
Composites are materials made from a combination of at least 2 materials to combine their strengths. They are usually made of a matrix material, like epoxy, and a fiber material, like burlap and canvas.
To make a composite, you need a mold with a bleeder layer, like saran wrap, fiber layers, a breather layer, like cotton, and another release layer. At the end, the object is sealed in a vacuum sealer in order to form the mold properly.
If you would like to learn more about composites, please see this website: https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Projects/composites_S19/index.html




The first thing that we needed to make was the design. This was done using both Fusion 360 and Rhino. The seashell the design was based off of this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52216217/61846068-b7d25e00-ae73-11e9-9c3b-4830557cd399.png)

At first, we followed a tutorial from https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate/how-would-you-model-a-seashell-in-fusion-360/td-p/8089867 to create the seashell. The design looks like this:

When we got to the lab, we realized that in order to make a mold for the shell, we needed to thicken the seashell since there were overhangs between the block and the shell ontop of the block (the CNC mill can’t make the overhangs). This proved to be difficult since the sculpt function was used in Fusion to make the shell and the program did not recognize it as a body to extrude. 
The problem is apparent in this image: <img width="691" alt="Screen Shot 2019-07-25 at 12 36 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52216217/61846223-4c3cc080-ae74-11e9-8ee7-fd2b55bc45ee.png">


After a long process, with the help of Nathan, we rescaled and flipped the shell in Rhino. It was then extruded, making the design below: <a href='seashell.stl' download>Click to download my STL file</a>



After finishing the design, we exported the file as an STL and began milling using the ShopBot machine. The machine is a 3-axis machine that uses the cartesian coordinate plane (x, y) but also moves up and down (z).  The material we used was foam. Between the rough and smooth pass we replaced the tool in the CNC mill. This was needed since the smooth pass needed much more accuracy for the crevices of our shell. Rob used a wrench to remove the collet nut and switch the tool for a ¼ in straight tool with 2 flutes. The foam mold turned out pretty well and all of the curves were pretty good. After it was made, I filled the crevices down to make them even more prominent so that the details show in the mold. 


Below I will attach a picture of the machine, the result, a video of the milling, and the filling tool.

After we finished creating the foam mold, we covered the mold with 2 layers of saran wrap. We also perforated an extra layer of saran wrap to use later with a spiky tool, and we cut a release layer made out of the same material as pillow stuffing. Then, we made mixed epoxy in a 1:2 ratio with ONS hardener and stirred it.

With the epoxy, we soaked small strips of canvas. The epoxy was not very easy to work with. It was messy and stuck to my gloves, and it hardened after a while. Usually, burlap is used instead of canvas for composite shells, but, for our specific design, we needed a more precise material for the shell crevices. 
The 1st composite layer (strips of canvas):
After the first layer of strips, we added two more layers of canvas (also soaked in epoxy). The next two layers were each just one square that covered the whole mold, and we plan on trimming it off. Then, after the layers of canvas, we added the saran wrap that was perforated earlier and the release layer on top of that. Finally, we placed the layers in a bag to go into a vacuum and sealed it with the machine.

Problems:
The main problem that we had was with extruding the seashell in Fusion order to create the mold because the shell was way too thin and had overhangs. Since the sculpt tool was used to make the shell, the shell could not be extruded in Fusion. I played around with rotation to try and place a rectangular block beneath the shell, but it did not work very well because the block kept on going through the shell. It was also difficult because the shell was oriented at an angle, and, since it was thin and had a more complex shape, it was not possible to get the block right underneath the shell without compromising any of the shell details. Eventually we extruded the shell in the Rhino software with Nathan’s help during the lab. One of the issues while doing this was that not all of the shell was recognized as connected within the program. To fix this, we increased the tolerance to decrease the distance between 2 points that is needed to recognize them as one. This was enough since the CNC machine was not affected by the open polysurface.


Thoughts + what I learned:
I have never used a CNC milling machine before, so it was really interesting to learn about the process. The machine first creates a rough pass and then refines it a second time in the smooth pass. The first pass creates a general shape, and the smooth pass creates curves and rounds. The composite shell process was also very interesting. I had never thought about combining two materials in such a way before. The canvas is strong when pulled but not compressed, and the glue is brittle when being pulled but strong when compressed. If these two materials are combined, the benefits of both materials are combined into one. Another interesting part about composites are the vacuum. It is a really innovative way to ensure that the mold adheres to the foam.

Tomorrow we will see how the shell turned out, and I am really excited to see if the details are well-defined.
