### Lab 5: 07/15/19

Today we worked on producing an output with an input button, a conditional statement, and a for loop. I created a timer using the Arduino Projects Book. In the book, I chose project #8, the digital hourglass. Since I did not have a tilt switch that was needed for the hourglass, I just made a timer instead using a regular button.

The circuit diagram that I used is here:

The materials that I used were wires, 5 LED lights, a button, a 10 kilolm resistor, and five 220 ohm resistors.


The next thing that I did after wiring the board was upload the code into the Arduino. The code that I used is below:

The delay between lights can be adjusted in the line “long interval = 2000;” by changing the numeric value (in milliseconds). For my circuit, I made the delay 2000 miliseconds, or 2 seconds, so that the entire circuit would be a 10 second timer. After 10 seconds is over, the lights stay on and the timer runs again when the button is pressed.

Here is my final result:
*i still have to add the video


What I learned: 
\n Overall, I gained more experience in programming an Arduino. I do not have much background in using Arudinos or programming, so it was very interesting to be exposed to the Arduino’s capabilities. I learned about for loops, conditional statements, input, and output. I also practiced declaring pins and, in general, writing code. The project book was very helpful in explaining what each line of code does, clarifying many things. 

If you would like to try some of the projects, here is the book link: https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf. It offers great tutorials for beginners and introduces new concepts.
